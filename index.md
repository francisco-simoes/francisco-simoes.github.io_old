During my studies (MSc), I walked the path between Theoretical Physics and Pure Mathematics.  I have recently transitioned to DS and AI.

Some of my programming, Data Science and AI projects can be found on [my github page](https://github.com/francisco-simoes).

In this website I store a selection of texts and notes, as well as links to some projects.
Many were written on Physics and Mathematics during my studies; others concern DS and AI topics.

Here you can also consult my CV.
