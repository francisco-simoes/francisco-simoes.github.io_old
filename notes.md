[Monoidal Category of D-branes in a Kazama-Suzuki  model](/assets/docs/Thesis_Francisco_Simoes.pdf)

This is my Master's thesis. It consists of an application of category theory to string theory. I included a brief introduction to both category theory and superstring theory. I believe it can be useful to someone trying to understand  Kac-Moody algebras in the context of string theory, and representation theory of the Virasoro algebra in general.

[Category of cobordisms, 2TQFTs and Frobenius algebras](/assets/docs/2TQFT_Frob.pdf)  

This is a summary of some contents of the book by Joachim Kock on TQFTs. It is the result of a month of self-study. These notes can be used alongside the book, but not by themselves. I hope they can be useful for a physicists trying to get a quick look into TQFTs from the categorical point of view.
