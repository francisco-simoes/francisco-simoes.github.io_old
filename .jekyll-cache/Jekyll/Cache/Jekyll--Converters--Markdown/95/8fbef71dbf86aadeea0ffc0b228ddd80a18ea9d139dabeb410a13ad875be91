<p>During my studies (MSc), I walked the path between Theoretical Physics and Pure Mathematics.  I have recently transitioned to DS and AI.</p>

<p>Some of my programming, Data Science and AI projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/francisco-simoes">github page</a>.</p>

<p>In this website I store a selection of texts and notes.
Some I wrote on Physics and Mathematics during my studies; others concern DS and AI topics.</p>

<p>Here you can also consult my CV.</p>
