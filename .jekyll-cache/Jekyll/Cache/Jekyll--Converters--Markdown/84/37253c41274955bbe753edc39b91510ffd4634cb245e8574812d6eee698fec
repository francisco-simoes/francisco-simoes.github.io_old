<a href="/assets/docs/Thesis_Francisco_Simoes.pdf">Monoidal Category of D-branes in a Kazama-Suzuki  model</a></p>

<p>This is my Master’s thesis. It consists of an application of category theory to string theory. I included a brief introduction to both category theory and superstring theory. I believe it can be useful to someone trying to understand  Kac-Moody algebras in the context of string theory, and representation theory of the Virasoro algebra in general.<br />

<a href="/assets/docs/2TQFT_Frob.pdf">Category of cobordisms, 2TQFTs and Frobenius algebras</a></p>

<p>This is a summary of some contents of the book by Joachim Kock on TQFTs. It is the result of a month of self-study. These notes can be used alongside the book, but not by themselves. I hope they can be useful for a physicists trying to get a quick look into TQFTs from the categorical point of view.

<a href="./assets/docs/ModularCats.pdf">Highway to modular categories</a></p>

<p>I summarized the quickest way I could find of going from monoidal categories all the way to modular categories. Up to pre-modular categories the treatment is quite complete, but after that the discussion gets more superficial as I was running out of time.
I believe this is a good document to read if you are a mathematical physicists trying to get to modular categories as quickly as possible. Read alongside “Tensor categories” by Etingof et al.

<a href="./assets/docs/tetrahedron_cell_structure_inv.pdf">Cell complex structure of the double tetrahedron</a></p>

<p>I construct the cell structure of the double tetrahedron, and use it to find its fundamental group. 
I solved this problem in the context of a course on algebraic geometry.

<a href="./assets/docs/AQuickTakeOnMetricAndTopology.pdf">Topological and metric spaces</a></p>

<p>This is a very quick take on metric and topological spaces. It is just enough to prepare a physicist to learn about manifolds for a General Relativity course.</p>

<a href="./assets/docs/TensorsQuickTake.pdf">Tensors</a><br />
Physicists usually treat tensors as indexed lists transforming in a certain way.
Here I briefly present a basis-invariant way to look at tensors which seems to me much more natural.
I also comment on how bras in Quantum Mechanics are examples of tensors.</p>
