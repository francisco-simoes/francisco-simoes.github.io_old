[Monoidal Category of D-branes in a Kazama-Suzuki  model](/assets/docs/Thesis_Francisco_Simoes.pdf)

This is my Master's thesis. It consists of an application of category theory to string theory. I included a brief introduction to both category theory and superstring theory. I believe it can be useful to someone trying to understand  Kac-Moody algebras in the context of string theory, and representation theory of the Virasoro algebra in general.

[Category of cobordisms, 2TQFTs and Frobenius algebras](/assets/docs/2TQFT_Frob.pdf)  

This is a summary of some contents of the book by Joachim Kock on TQFTs. It is the result of a month of self-study. These notes can be used alongside the book, but not by themselves. I hope they can be useful for a physicists trying to get a quick look into TQFTs from the categorical point of view.

[Highway to modular categories](./assets/docs/ModularCats.pdf)  

I summarized the quickest way I could find of going from monoidal categories all the way to modular categories. Up to pre-modular categories the treatment is quite complete, but after that the discussion gets more superficial as I was running out of time.
I believe this is a good document to read if you are a mathematical physicists trying to get to modular categories as quickly as possible. Read alongside "Tensor categories" by Etingof et al.

[Cell complex structure of the double tetrahedron](./assets/docs/tetrahedron_cell_structure.pdf)  

I construct the cell structure of the double tetrahedron, and use it to find its fundamental group. I solved this problem in the context of a course on algebraic geometry.
